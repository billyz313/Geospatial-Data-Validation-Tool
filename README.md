## Overview

The Geospatial Data Validation Tool is designed to facilitate the validation and verification of geospatial datasets. This tool helps ensure the quality and consistency of geospatial data through various checks and validations. It supports common geospatial formats such as Shapefiles and GeoJSON.

## Features

1. **Topology Checks**
   - Detect overlapping polygons, gaps, or slivers.
   - Check for self-intersecting geometries.

2. **Coordinate System Validation**
   - Verify that datasets use consistent coordinate reference systems (CRS).
   - Offer automatic re-projection options.

3. **Data Completeness**
   - Identify missing attributes or incomplete records.
   - Validate attribute data types and value ranges.

4. **Error Reporting**
   - Generate detailed reports with visualizations of detected issues.
   - Provide recommendations for fixing errors.

5. **Input/Output Formats**
   - Support for common geospatial formats including Shapefiles, GeoJSON, and others.

## Installation

There are a few different options, choose the one that is best for you.

**Install from conda:**
```bash
conda install billyz313::poly-validator
```

**Install from pip**
```bash
pip install poly-validator
```

**Install from repo**

- Using conda:
      
      
      git clone https://github.com/billyz313/Geospatial-Data-Validation-Tool.git
      cd Geospatial-Data-Validation-Tool
      
      conda env create -f environment.yml
      conda activate geovalidator
      
      
**OR**

- Using venv:

      bash
      git clone https://github.com/billyz313/Geospatial-Data-Validation-Tool.git
      cd Geospatial-Data-Validation-Tool
      
      python3 -m venv geovalidator
      source geovalidator/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `geovalidator\Scripts\activate`
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      

## Usage

### Load and Validate Geospatial Data

To load a GeoJSON file and perform validations, use the following script:

```python
import geopandas as gpd
from polyvalidator.validators.topology import detect_overlaps, detect_gaps, detect_slivers, check_self_intersection

# Load the GeoJSON file
file_path = 'path/to/your/file.geojson'
gdf = gpd.read_file(file_path)

# Apply validation functions
overlapping_polygons = detect_overlaps(gdf)
gaps = detect_gaps(gdf)
slivers = detect_slivers(gdf, area_threshold=0.01)  # Adjust area_threshold as needed
self_intersections = check_self_intersection(gdf)

# Print results
print("Overlapping Polygons:")
print(overlapping_polygons)

print("\nGaps:")
print(gaps)

print("\nSlivers:")
print(slivers)

print("\nSelf-Intersecting Geometries:")
print(self_intersections)

```
